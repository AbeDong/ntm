# Neural Turing Machines

Tensorflow implementation of Neural Turing Machines, as well as its application on one-shot learning (unfinished).

## Prerequisites

* Python 3.5
* TensorFlow 1.2.0
* NumPy

## Implementation of NTM

## One-shot Learning Using NTM

(in progress...)

## Roadmap

* Implement Neural Turing Machines (NTM) (Reference: [link](https://arxiv.org/abs/1410.5401))
* Apply NTM to one-shot learning (Reference: [link](https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.06065))
* Implement Differentiable Neural Computer (DNC) based on NTM (Reference: [link](https://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v538/n7626/abs/nature20101.html))
* Apply DNC to one-shot learning
* Other improvements (during the whole progress)
